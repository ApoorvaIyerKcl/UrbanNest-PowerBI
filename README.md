# Homestyle-PowerBI

## Executive Summary

HomeStyle is a multi-city home décor and home utility retailer offering a wide range of products across furniture, lighting, storage, kitchen, and furnishing categories. As the business expanded across regions, store formats, and customer segments, leadership needed a consolidated analytical view to understand how customers shop, which products and cities drive profitability, and how discounts, promotions, and financing influence revenue. This project brings together customer, sales, product, payment, and operational data into an integrated analytics model to support strategic, data-driven decision-making across the organization.


## Business Problem

HomeStyle faced challenges in clearly identifying its strongest customer segments, high-performing cities and regions, and the true profitability of its product portfolio. Sales data existed across multiple dimensions such as store type, brand, loyalty tier, and payment method, but lacked a unified structure for analysis. Leadership needed clarity on repeat versus one-time customers, the impact of promotions and discounts on profit margins, regional sales concentration, and operational performance indicators such as delivery timelines. Without a centralized analytical layer, decision-making around inventory planning, pricing strategy, store expansion, and customer retention remained largely reactive rather than insight-driven.
