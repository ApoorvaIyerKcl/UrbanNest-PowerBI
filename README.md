# Homestyle-PowerBI

## Executive Summary

HomeStyle is a multi-category **home decor and home utility retailer** operating across cities, regions, store formats, and customer segments. This project analyses **customers, sales, products, payments, and operations** to provide a single analytical view of **revenue performance, profitability, customer behavior, and operational efficiency**. Using structured transactional data, the analysis supports **executive decision-making**, highlights **growth drivers**, and identifies **risk areas** across geography, loyalty tiers, product value bands, and store formats. **This is a data analysis project for the retail industry.**


## Business Problem

As HomeStyle expanded its product range and regional footprint, decision-making became fragmented across teams. Leadership lacked a consolidated view of **net sales, profit margins, customer repeat behavior, promotion impact, and delivery performance**. Questions around **which cities, store types, customer segments, and product categories drive sustainable profit** remained unanswered. This project addresses the need for a **centralized analytics layer** to transform raw transactional data into **actionable business insights**.
